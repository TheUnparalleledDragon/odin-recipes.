    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a bit of a project and is time-consuming, but I have never been disappointed with the results. Since it is such a festive dish, I usually make it for dinner parties. It is a huge hit.</p>

    <p>We as the title suggests will be making a Ghost Biryani unlike the Chicken Biryani, which is also indeed very popular and cheap as well. We would like more <em>protein</em> this time around.</p>
